# Advent of Code 2023

Hello! These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenge of 2023.

# Building

My solutions are written using c++23 and compiled with mingw gcc 13.2.0.

Using `make` in the root directory should build all the solutions and produce the resulting executable in the root directory.

# Some reflections

## Day 3

I really went overboard with ranges. This was way too clever for my liking.

This was the first time in all the years of coding that I have ever used a multimap.

## Day 5

The increase in complexity between part 1 and 2 was unexpected. Perhaps, there is a more efficient way working backwards from a result.

## Day 8

Part 2 is not a full solution, but given the input one was not required.

A full solution would require a system to combine multiple looping paths to determine when their terminal nodes overlap.
